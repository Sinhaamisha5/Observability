Case Study: Designing a Scalable Monitoring Architecture for 200+ Microservices
Context
In my previous role (or you can say “in a project scenario”), our organization had migrated from a monolithic system to a microservices-based architecture running over Kubernetes.
We had around 200+ microservices deployed across multiple clusters — production, staging, and development.
Each microservice had different teams owning it, with different languages (Java, Node.js, Python), and we faced a major challenge in observability and monitoring.
Problem Statement
Initially, every team used its own monitoring setup — some pushed logs to CloudWatch, some had separate Prometheus instances, and alerts were inconsistent.
We faced issues like:
•	Lack of centralized visibility — no single place to see service health.
•	Alerts were noisy and unstructured.
•	Root cause analysis took too long because logs, metrics, and traces were not correlated.
•	Prometheus instances were becoming unstable as we added more services and metrics.
The goal was to design a centralized, scalable monitoring and observability platform that supports:
•	200+ microservices
•	Multi-cluster Kubernetes environment
•	Metrics, Logs, and Traces correlation
•	Automated alerting and dashboards per service
Proposed Solution
I proposed building a modern observability stack using Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki, and Tempo, backed by Thanos for long-term storage.
Architecture Overview
1.	Per-Cluster Prometheus Setup
o	Each Kubernetes cluster runs a local Prometheus instance (HA setup) using the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart.
o	Prometheus scrapes metrics from:
	Application Pods (via /metrics endpoint)
	Node Exporter (for node-level metrics)
	cAdvisor / kube-state-metrics (for pod/container stats)
o	To avoid overloading, we tuned the scrape interval to 30 seconds and used relabeling to drop unnecessary labels.
2.	Centralized Long-Term Storage – Thanos
o	Each Prometheus was configured with remote_write to Thanos Receive.
o	Thanos Compact + Store Gateway handled long-term data retention in AWS S3.
o	The Thanos Querier layer aggregated metrics from all clusters — allowing us to visualize everything in a single Grafana instance.
o	This solved the scalability and retention problem.
3.	Centralized Grafana
o	A single Grafana instance connected to the Thanos Querier and Loki.
o	Dashboards were automatically provisioned via JSON templates.
o	Each microservice had a standard dashboard layout:
	CPU / Memory usage
	Request rate, error rate, latency (RED metrics)
	Dependency service latency
	Pod availability and restart counts
	SLO compliance
4.	Alerting with Alertmanager
o	Each Prometheus instance sent alerts to a central Alertmanager cluster.
o	Alert rules were standardized using a shared rule set.
o	We configured routes in Alertmanager:
	Critical alerts → PagerDuty
	Warning alerts → Slack channels
	Info alerts → Email notifications
o	Added inhibition rules to prevent duplicate alerts (for example, suppress pod-level alerts when the node itself is down).
5.	Logs – Fluent Bit + Loki
o	Every cluster deployed Fluent Bit DaemonSet to collect stdout/stderr logs from pods.
o	Logs were sent to Grafana Loki, where logs were indexed by service name, namespace, and pod.
o	This allowed easy correlation between metrics and logs in Grafana — e.g., clicking a spike in latency opens related logs.
6.	Traces – OpenTelemetry + Tempo
o	Applications were instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDK.
o	Traces were sent to Grafana Tempo, allowing us to trace requests across microservices.
o	This made root-cause analysis much faster — from the Grafana dashboard, we could jump from metrics → logs → trace view.
7.	Synthetic Monitoring
o	We added Blackbox Exporter to run synthetic HTTP checks for critical APIs.
o	The metrics from Blackbox Exporter were integrated into Prometheus and visualized in Grafana.
8.	Service Ownership & SLO Tracking
o	Integrated a CMDB (Configuration Management Database) containing service owners, SLO definitions, and alert mappings.
o	Grafana dashboards dynamically pulled this info to show ownership and SLO compliance per service.
Implementation Highlights
•	Used Helm charts to standardize deployments across environments.
•	Automated provisioning of dashboards and alerts using GitOps (via ArgoCD).
•	Used Prometheus Federation initially but later moved to remote_write → Thanos for scalability.
•	Created labeling standards to avoid high cardinality issues.
•	Set retention policies:
o	High-resolution metrics: 15 days
o	Downsampled data: 6 months
•	Created a runbook library linked to each alert in Grafana.
Challenges Faced
1.	High cardinality metrics
o	Some developers added dynamic labels (like request_id) — this caused memory spikes.
o	Solution: implemented Prometheus relabeling rules to drop these labels.
2.	Alert fatigue
o	Initially, too many alerts were firing.
o	Solution: introduced alert grouping and inhibition rules in Alertmanager.
3.	Scaling storage
o	Thanos object store costs grew.
o	Solution: implemented data downsampling and lifecycle policies in S3.
4.	Cross-team visibility
o	Some teams didn’t know how to use dashboards.
o	Solution: conducted training and created Grafana folders per team.
Results
•	Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) reduced by ~40%.
•	Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) reduced by ~50%.
•	Reduced monitoring cost by 30% by using Thanos + object storage instead of multiple Prometheus instances.
•	Improved developer autonomy — each team could view their own dashboards and alerts without central ops dependency.
•	Built a reliable end-to-end observability platform covering metrics, logs, and traces in one place.

Key Takeaways to Say in Interview
“Through this project, I learned the importance of designing a centralized, scalable observability stack.
We made monitoring more reliable, standardized alerts, and empowered developers to troubleshoot faster.
We used Prometheus, Thanos, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and Alertmanager to handle over 200+ microservices efficiently, focusing on high availability, low alert noise, and cost optimization.”
